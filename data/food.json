The nutritional profile of organic and grass-fed yogurt is fantastic and Greek style yogurt is strained which increases the protein and decreases the lactose.  Avoid buying flavored yogurts of any kind as they are loaded with sugar and cancel the probiotic effect. If you cant find 100% grass-fed buy organic I would not eat conventional dairy because the cows eat GMO grains.",
